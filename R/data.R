#' Human lung capacity data
#'
#' The data set reported in Barnett (1969) involves different instruments for measuring human
#' lung capacity. These data were collected as part of a medical study to compare the relative merits of
#' two instruments designed to measure human lung function-specific aspects. One of the two
#' instruments is the standard, and the other is a new instrument, which, among other features,
#' requires less skill in its operation. So, the study considers two operators, one skilled and one
#' unskilled, to take the measurements on 72 patients.
